> "If I have seen further it is by standing on the sholder of giants." ~ Sir Issac Newton

Essentially, we make intellectual progress by using the understanding gained by major thinkers who have come and gone before us.  Building, using, and improving R and all things done in R has taken a *community* of people. No one person could have made R what it is today, and for that we not only use the resources made by others, but also make resources for others to use! *You can start being a sholder for others today!*
